-Highest rating of all trucks entered

-Quit the program

# Lessons Learned
-Just staring at the screen does not produce any code. I was only able to come up with solutions a lot of the time once I started writing. 

-I had a lot of trouble with methods and arrays during this homework. I do understand the getters and setters mostly now though.

-This is definitely a project I need to revisit at some point.

-I seem to have gained a better understanding using boolean, if/else, do/while 

-There's no such thing as an easy project when you are new to something.
# Issues I ran into
-Although I technically did not use any non-static methods other than main I still should have been able to put a lot of my code into non-static methods and call them. I could not come up with the solution.

-I was struggling a lot with making each part of my program have call-able methods without using Static. I ended up putting the majority of my code within the main method. Hopefully with the next week(s) I will gain more understanding to use non-static methods.

-Doubting whether what I was writing would work. 

-I do not have a good understanding of methods or arrays yet. I was confused when I tried to use methods within my FoodTruckApp class. I ended up only completing the minimum requirements of the homework.
